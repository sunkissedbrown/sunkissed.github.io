    <h2>VOICE</h2>

    <img src="images/jayne-pic2.jpg" alt="Jayne" class="jayne-pic2"/>

    <p>Today, I'm going tell you a story.</p>

    <p>It's the story of a girl, a little black girl to be exact, who lived most of her years with stories, thoughts and writings that she yearned to share with the world. </p>
        
    <p>But her biggest antagonist was self-doubt. It's one thing to have others tell you you're not good enough and that your voice doesn't matter, but to actually believe is quite crippling. </p>
        
    <p>One day that girl decided to go to South Korea, a place so foreign where the culture was far different from her own, but where she could finally figure out who she was as a black girl, learn to understand who she was meant to be in a world that wasn't entirely made for her, and find the voice that was silenced so many times before. And so she went and she did. </p>
        
    <p>As you might have guessed by now, that little girl is me, Jayne. The girl who is still trying to move past her fears and self-doubt to finally start building her legacy and share her story. </p>
        
    <p>2020 was the year of the impossible. This year gave me the courage to stand up for myself and let go of the things that weren't meant for me. That defining moment was when I got unexpectedly laid off. The irony is that this situation came right after I spoke up and made sure the voices of my community were finally heard. And all of that happened in the midst of injustice and inequality conversations. Being let go was a reminder that my purpose to tell my story and those of others, although defied, is still intentional, needed and does matter. </p>
        
    <p>This scholarship will lead me to the path that I am destined for. It will give me the additional tools and skillset that I need to tell and create stories in a meaningful way and to help others bring their own stories to life. Whether it is through personal or business brands, I want to build up my community and uplift them by crafting their message and making sure it is heard.</p>
    
    <p>So thank you for considering me for this scholarship and for giving me a chance to hone my purpose and share it with others.</p>
